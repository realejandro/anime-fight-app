 ## Project Description
 
 Our team created an Anime Fight Club application. We wanted to settle the debate of "Which anime has the strongest fighters", now using our app you can randomly generate a winner and finally put an end to those arugements with your friends. To start we decided on a list of 5 animes and 5 characthers from each anime. We then have the user submit their first and second anime choices from the list provided and once they hit submit their choices are locked in. The Last Step is to hit the "Fight!" button and then your fighter is randomly chosen as the victor or the loser. We used HTML to make the base for the project and display our list of animes and we used CSS to style or project and to resize the images, we used Javascript to add our fighters into the their box and to make it randomly select a winner and also save the wins to local storage.  We also used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for our "Fighter box", "Fight! Button" , and our "Winner Modal" to make everything more cohesive and responsive.
